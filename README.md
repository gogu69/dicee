## My process

1. The project started as a minimalist dice game without a specific design, but with full responsiveness across resolutions and orientations (portrait and landscape).
2.  The focus was on functionality rather than aestheticsâ€”colors were chosen randomly, without deliberate design intent.
3.  The main goal was to integrate simple JavaScript functions into a document built with HTML and CSS.
